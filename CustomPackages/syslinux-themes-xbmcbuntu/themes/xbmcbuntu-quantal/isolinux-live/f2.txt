You must have at least 44 megabytes of RAM to use this Ubuntu installer.

You should have space on your hard disk to create a new disk partition
of at least 500 megabytes for a minimal server installation. You'll need
more disk space to install additional packages, depending on what you
wish to do with your new XBMCbuntu system.

You should have a video adaptor capable of accellerated OpenGL to enjoy
the full power of XBMC. 
Any recent NVIDIA/AMD/Intel cards should be powerful enough.

See the Installation Guide or the FAQ for more information; both
documents are available at the XBMC web site, 0fhttp://www.xbmc.org/07

Thank you for choosing XBMCbuntu!
